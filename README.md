## For Transfer

See [Articulation Agreement by Major - Computer Science: Computer Game Design, B.S.](http://web2.assist.org/cgi-bin/REPORT_2/Rep2.pl?aay=16-17&dora=CMPSG&oia=UCSC&ay=16-17&event=19&ria=UCSC&agreement=aa&sia=MARIN&ia=MARIN&dir=1&&sidebar=false&rinst=left&mver=2&kind=5&dt=2)

*IGETC: The School of Engineering strongly discourages the use of IGETC as students will use non-engineering classes to complement quarters with challenging courses in the major.*

### 'FOUNDATION COURSES' FOR ADMISSION TO THE MAJOR

Transfer students must have completed all of the foundation courses or their articulated equivalents with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.8 in these courses:

## For Major

### Additional recommendations

The School of Engineering recommends (but does not require) that students take additional community college courses on film and digital media production topics, including but not limited to digital art (Photoshop, Illustrator, or equivalent), digital modeling (3D Studio Max, Maya, or equivalent), and digital film production (Final Cut Pro, Premiere, or equivalent).

For transfer students only, any course focused on the history of modern art (after 1900 C.E.) may satisfy the HAVC 141 requirement.

It is also recommended that transfer students who intend to begin their studies in the fall quarter take course CMPS 101: Algorithms and Abstract Data Types during the summer session at UCSC just prior to entry. Since many game engineering elective courses require CMPS 101 as a prerequisite, this gives transfer students a broader array of course choices during their first year at UCSC.

### Admission to our Computer Science: Computer Game Design major is selective.

Students will only be considered if they have completed most or all of the Foundation Courses: CMPS 12A, CMPS 12B, CMPE 16, MATH 19A, and MATH 19B.  Furthermore, it must be clear that you are capable of completing the major in a 'reasonable period of time'. Therefore, you are encouraged to complete as many as possible of the lower-division courses in your major before applying for admission to UCSC. We strongly recommend that you have completed:

|   | UCSC Course   | UCSC Title                                         | COM Course        | COM Title                           | Credits |

| . | CMPS&nbsp;12A | Introduction to Programming (Accelerated)          | COMP&nbsp;135/232 |                                           | 8       |
|   | CMPS&nbsp;12B | Introduction to Data Structures                    | COMP&nbsp;220     | Data Structures and Algorithms           | 3       |
|   | PHYS&nbsp;5A  |                                                    | PHYS&nbsp;110     | Introductory Physics                     | 3       |


*When there are more applicants than spaces available, priority is given to transfers from California Community Colleges who have completed all the lower division classes listed above and have a high GPA.*

NOTE:
1. To be reviewed for admission, you must indicate a School of Engineering (SoE) major as your first choice on your application.
2. The courses to be considered for credit for our Foundation Courses (see above) must be covered by an articulation agreement with UCSC.  If not, you will have to submit course descriptions and syllabi for each course to be considered.
3. *IGETC: NOT RECOMMENDED* for students wishing to complete this major.  Instead, we recommended you take as many technical courses as possible, leaving general education courses to take at UCSC. This allows a schedule of 2/3 technical courses and 1/3 general education courses which students find to be a more reasonable load than taking only technical courses.

Students interested in admission to Computer Science: Computer Game Design B.S.  major should contact the Baskin School of Engineering Undergraduate Advising Office at 831-459-5840 or e-mail advising@soe.ucsc.edu.
